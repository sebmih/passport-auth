PassportAuth
==============

A small but pretty awesome project about some users creating an account, logging in and then creating meetings.

Steps to run the app
=====================
* After cloning the repo, install the dependencies by running **npm install**
* To start the server, run **npm start** on the base directory

Requirements
============
I assume that you have a local mongo instance running. If you have mongo installed locally, all you need to do is configure the db.js file correctly and run the mongod daemon
